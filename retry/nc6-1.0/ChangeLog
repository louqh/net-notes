2005-08-18 Chris Leishman <chris@leishman.org>

	* Moved afindep and bluez network code to separate modules with very

	  arguments for optional components (such as bluetooth), but now gives
	  an appropriate error if used.
	* Updated man page with bluetooth options.
	* Created a system.h header for system specific defines, which
	  includes autoconfs config.h.
	* Changed boolean types to use stdbool.h (where available)

	  struct name.

	    setting up the remote_stream directly.
	  - Added do_listen_continous() to allow for and inetd like mode.
	  - An open3 function for exec'ing and talking to an external process (to

2002-12-29 Chris Leishman <chris@leishman.org>

	  - Added support for setting the buffer sizes.
	  - Added support for configuring MTU's and NRU's.
	* Added long option support.

	  supported at compile time, and moved other checks to runtime.  Ensured ipv6
	  support is fully optional.
	* Tested builds are successful on *BSD and linux systems, with and without
	  ipv6 support.
	* Reworked readwrite() to ensure buffers are correctly flushed before the
	  connection closes.

	  SEND_DATA_ONLY flag.
